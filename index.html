      <h2>🪐 Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.
        It has extreme temperatures, ranging from scorching hot to freezing cold.
        It's named after the Roman messenger god.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercury's surface is covered in craters and has a day longer than its year. It experiences extreme temperature
        variations, from 800 degrees Fahrenheit (427 degrees Celsius) during the day to -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-179
        degrees
        Celsius) at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn't have
        any
        moons or rings.

      <h2>🪐 Venus</h2>
      <p>
        Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and mass.
        It has a thick atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide.
        Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, known as retrograde rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet. Its surface is marked by vast
        volcanic
        plains and highland regions. The planet rotates so slowly that a day on Venus is longer than its year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Earth, Venus has no moons. It just gracefully orbits the Sun on its own, shrouded in its thick, toxic
        atmosphere.

      <h2> 🌎 Earth </h2>
      <p>
        Earth is our home, the only known planet to support life.
        It has a diverse climate, from icy polar regions to hot deserts.
        The only planet with liquid water on its surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earth's atmosphere contains life-sustaining oxygen. It has a magnetic field that protects us from harmful solar
        radiation. The diverse ecosystems range from lush rainforests to vast deserts, fostering a rich variety of life.

      <h2>🪐 Mars</h2>
      <p>
        Known as the "Red Planet" due to its iron oxide-rich surface.
        Mars has the tallest volcano and the largest canyon in the solar system.
        It has been a focus for possible future human colonization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mars is a cold desert world. It has polar ice caps and a thin atmosphere.
        Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
        Mars is known as the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons! This massive shield volcano is about 13.6
        miles (22 km) high, nearly three times the height of Mount Everest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reddish hue of Mars comes from iron minerals in its soil oxidizing, or rusting. That's why it's famously
        known as the "Red Planet."
      </p>
      <p>
        Mars experiences colossal dust storms that can sometimes engulf the entire planet for months! These storms are
        the largest in our solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons named Phobos and Deimos. The planet's surface features enormous
        volcanoes
        and a canyon, Valles Marineris, that dwarfs the Grand Canyon on Earth. Mars also experiences dust storms that
        can
        envelop the entire planet.

      <h2>🪐 Jupiter</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.
        It has a thick atmosphere, with swirling storms and the Great Red Spot.
        Jupiter has more than 70 moons, including the four large Galilean moons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jupiter is so massive that it's more than twice as massive as all the other planets in our solar system
        combined! You could fit over 1,300 Earths inside Jupiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that has been raging for at least 350 years and is larger than
        Earth itself!
      </p>
      <p>
        Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets, spinning around once every 10 hours. This super-fast rotation
        causes its atmosphere to flatten at the poles and bulge at the equator.
      </p>

      <h2>🪐 Saturn</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn is known for its rings. It has the most extensive ring system of any planet in the solar system.
        Saturn's rings are made primarily of "water ice" mixed with dust and other chemicals.
        Saturn has more than 80 moons, including the largest moon in the solar system, Titan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saturn's magnificent rings are incredibly thin! Though they stretch hundreds of thousands of miles across, they
        are typically only about 30 feet (10 meters) thick.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you had a bathtub big enough, Saturn would float! It's the only planet in our solar system less dense than
        water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saturn's moon Titan is unique for having a thick atmosphere and stable bodies of liquid on its surface – though
        these are lakes of methane and ethane, not water!
      </p>

      <h2>🪐 Uranus</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus is the coldest planet in the solar system.
        It has a unique rotation - it spins on its side.
        Uranus has faint rings and 27 moons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uranus is the only planet that rotates on its side, like a rolling ball! Scientists believe a massive collision
        early in its history might have caused this unusual tilt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being farther from the Sun, Uranus is colder than Neptune, making it the coldest planet in our solar
        system, with temperatures dropping to -371°F (-224°C).
      </p>
      <p>
        Uranus has faint rings, but unlike Saturn's icy rings, Uranus's rings are made of dark particles. It also has 27
        known moons, many named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
      </p>

      <h2>🪐 Neptune</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune boasts the fastest winds in the solar system, with speeds reaching over 1,200 miles per hour (2,000
        km/h)! These supersonic winds drive massive storms across its surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neptune's distinct blue color comes from the methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects
        blue light back into space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Neptune is so far away, it takes about 165 Earth years for it to complete one orbit around the Sun. This
        means a single "year" on Neptune is longer than a human lifetime!
      </p>
