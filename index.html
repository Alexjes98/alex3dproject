        <h2>ü™ê Mercury</h2>
        <p>
            Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.
            It has extreme temperatures, ranging from scorching hot to freezing cold.
            It's named after the Roman messenger god.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Mercury's surface is covered in craters and has a day longer than its year. It experiences extreme temperature
          variations, from 800 degrees Fahrenheit (427 degrees Celsius) during the day to -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-179 degrees
          Celsius) at night.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn't have any
          moons or rings.

        <h2>ü™ê Venus</h2>
        <p>
          Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and mass.
          It has a thick atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide.
          Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, known as retrograde rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet. Its surface is marked by vast volcanic
          plains and highland regions. The planet rotates so slowly that a day on Venus is longer than its year.

        <h2> üåé Earth </h2>
        <p>
          Earth is our home, the only known planet to support life.
          It has a diverse climate, from icy polar regions to hot deserts.
          The only planet with liquid water on its surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earth's atmosphere contains life-sustaining oxygen. It has a magnetic field that protects us from harmful solar
          radiation. The diverse ecosystems range from lush rainforests to vast deserts, fostering a rich variety of life.

        <h2>ü™ê Mars</h2>
        <p>
          Known as the "Red Planet" due to its iron oxide-rich surface.
          Mars has the tallest volcano and the largest canyon in the solar system.
          It has been a focus for possible future human colonization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mars is a cold desert world. It has polar ice caps and a thin atmosphere.
            Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
            Mars is known as the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance.

        <h2>ü™ê Neptune</h2>
        <p>
          Neptune is the furthest known planet in our solar system.
          It has the fastest winds among the planets, reaching speeds of up to 1,500 miles per hour.
          Neptune's blue color is due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neptune's blue color comes from its atmosphere's methane content. The planet has a storm system named the Great Dark
          Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Neptune's winds can reach supersonic speeds, creating a dynamic and turbulent
          atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun. It has a thick atmosphere and active weather. Neptune has 14 moons and a
